      <description>About The Project Implemented various algorithm to conduct F1Tenth Racing including pure pursuit, RRT, and RRT*.
Built With Python NumPy Emergency Braking Implemented Emergency Braking for the car using LiDAR scans and calculating the instantaneous Time to Collision (iTTC).
Wall Following Implemented PID control in the time domain to give commands to the vehicle to follow the wall. Used LiDAR data to calculate the distance from the wall.

Tobby has to navigate around the classroom and collect materials to meet his target, but once Tobby eats a number, it does not appear again. (Also, remeber you are Tobby&amp;rsquo;s gardian, which means you have to be responsible for remebering his collections : )

      <description>Motivation: In taking our project to the next level, we wanted to allow our robot to draw on a large curved surface. This repository is for calculating the trajectory for following the curved wall.
Input: Mesh wall in .obj file form
Output: ridgeback trajectory
something like this:
X:-1.65, -0.86, -0.09, 1.64, 2.52, 3.6, 5.25, 5.27, 6.71, 7.09, 7.87, 9.79, 9.86 Y: -4.0, -4.34, -4.4, -4.31, -4.52, -4.04, -3.64, -3.65, -4.</description>
